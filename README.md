# IPCCbro
This is a chatbot built using OpenAI's API to verify claims and answer questions about Climate Change based on the IPCC reports. (NOTE - this is an unofficial chatbot; I have no connection to the authors of the IPCC reports.)

Here's a link to the Streamlit Chatbot I built:

Updates on 11th May:
This chatbot has been DISABLED as of 11th May, 12:00 PM IST. 
There were some pressing issues in the chatbot - it was hallucinating a lot of facts. Therefore it cannot be relied on for accurate information.
